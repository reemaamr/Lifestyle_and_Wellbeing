## Project Motivation
in this project, I was intrested on how the lifestyle of individuals can affect their overall wellness and work-life balance. Using Lifestyle and Wellbeing dataset, we could obtain several results which are:
1. who stress, lose vacations, and shouting have imbalanced work-life?
2. Do activities reduce stress?
3. Do healthy behaviors relate to BMI?
